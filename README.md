# TankRevamping-Hackathon
# Mississippi Choctaw Hackathon: Between the Earth and Sky

# 3rd place winner

Our product was created so that it can assist companies that utilize and sell gas tanks. This will be beneficial to companies because it is great way to be able to keep a proverbial eye on the tanks and send continuous results to a cell phone via email or text. Basically, it would just be an add on to what the companies already have and improve that. With the challenge given we were asked to come up with a way to:
1) Get the information that is already coming to the worker via a print out, and have that same information go to the higher ups in the business. When this information comes to the workers computer it will also go to the Manager’s phone. And that way he doesn’t have to go out of his way to either ask for the information or to retrieve it himself. 
2) We would be utilizing a proximity sensor that is placed onto the gas grate and when that grate is moved it will the trigger a response in a camera close by to turn on and send a live feed to the Managers phone.
